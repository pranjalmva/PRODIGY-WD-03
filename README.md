<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a well-structured Tic Tac Toe game! Here's a breakdown of the code with some suggestions for improvement:

# HTML Structure:

* The HTML uses a clear separation between the header, game board (container), restart button, popup window, and script reference.
* The use of classes for buttons ("button-option") allows for easy styling in a separate CSS file (linked in the <head> section).

# Content:

* The game board is displayed using nine buttons, providing a familiar interface for users.
A dedicated "Restart" button allows users to easily start a new game.
A popup window with a message area and "New Game" button is included, likely for displaying game results or other notifications.

# Usability:

* The minimalistic design keeps the focus on the game itself.
* The "Restart" button is clearly labeled and positioned for easy access.

# Suggestions for Improvement:

* <h4>Visual Design:</h4> Consider adding a background image or color scheme to enhance the game's visual appeal.
* <h4>Button Design:</h4> Style the buttons (".button-option") in your CSS file to make them visually distinct and indicate if a square is occupied.
* <h4>Functionality:</h4> Implement the game logic in the JavaScript file ("script.js") to handle player turns, win conditions, and display updates.
* <h4>Popup Functionality:</h4> Connect the popup elements with JavaScript to display messages like "Winner!" or "Tie" and allow restarting the game through the "New Game" button.
* Responsiveness:</h4> Test the game on different devices (mobile, tablet) to ensure proper scaling and usability.
